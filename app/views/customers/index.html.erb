		<h4>Get Started!</h4>
		Add your first customer by clicking below.  You can keep it simple or create an organization tree showing a hierarchy so a "customer" can be a company, division or any business unit that you would like to track separately. For more complex structures start with the top most unit and add sub-units later on.

			<h4>Tip!</h4>
	        Partners and customers are associated through contracts.  Once you have at least one of each you will be able to get an overall heatcheck by creating a contract.  You will also be able to track issues across all companies for a particular partner.
